------------------
Note: our OpenLayers-2.10 contained here has the following patches already applied.

0.
 a) Apply http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/ticket/2492 this patch to OpenLayers.  Ugh.
 b) Apply <<URL HERE>> this patch to OpenLayers.
 c) If not using OpenLayers >= 2.11, apply this patch to OpenLayers: http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/attachment/ticket/2670/2670.1-trunk.patch.  Once we switch to OpenLayers 2.11 this step can be removed.  See http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/ticket/2670 and http://trac.osgeo.org/openlayers/ticket/3395.
------------------

1. Use cp sapling.cfg to the OpenLayers/build directory.
2. cd OpenLayers/build, run ./buildUncompressed sapling
3. Remove extra JS logic in the OpenLayers.js file.
   Open OpenLayers.js and remove all references to singleFile:

   Line 103:

    <     singleFile: true

   Line 129:

    <     var singleFile = (typeof OpenLayers == "object" && OpenLayers.singleFile);

    Line 147, change to:

    <         _scriptName: (!singleFile) ? "lib/OpenLayers.js" : "OpenLayers.js",
    ---
    >         _scriptName: "OpenLayers.js",

    Line 187, remove the whole area between braces:

    <     if(!singleFile) {
            < remove everything here >
            ...
    <     }

4. Run the resulting OpenLayers.js through the closure compiler with SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS.
5. Add this comment to the top of OpenLayers.js:

   /*License info: license.txt in this directory*/
6. Copy OpenLayers.js, license.txt to sapling/utils/static/openlayers/
